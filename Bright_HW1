# Homework 1 - Coinbase

## Overview and Origin:

* Coinbase was incorporated in San Francisco, California in July of 2012. Founded by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam with the goal to develop an “open financial system for the world”. Prior to Coinbase, online wallets for crypto assets were often stored under a lengthy code or hardware wallet. Very easy to misplace, and once misplaced the funds were not retrievable. Coinbase assessed this issue by hosting online wallets through to follow their mission of creating an “open financial system for the world”. They define an “open financial system” as an easy to access system not controlled by government entities, allowing for more equality amongst users. Coinbase created a platform to not only broker crypto assets, but also keep them safe. 
* Safety is the top priority of Coinbase. Since the beginning they have kept in contact with legal entities and the SEC to make sure their processes and technologies are up to snuff. The crypto asset industry remains quite grey when it comes to legalities, but Coinbase ensures their clients safety when using their platform. Their great attention to detail lead Coinbase to acquire plenty of equity financing through various large investors such as; USAA, BBVA, SVAngel, SOZO Ventures, and the NYSE. 

## Business Activities:

* Coinbase offers a safe and reliable source to buy, sell and store crypto assets. Their client base consists of both institutional and retail investors. As a retail investor, Coinbase operates very similarly to other stock brokerage applications. They offer free sign-up and charge roughly 1.5-4% per trade depending on the payment method of the client. Institutional investors are a new market for Coinbase, and they have launched a variety of new Coinbase products to best suit their needs. Institutional investors now take up roughly 60% of all trading volume. As one of the first safe crypto asset brokerages to hit the market for both retail and institutional clientele, they have the first mover advantage. Their most valuable advantage is their safety protocol as being one of the few that has not been hacked. 
* Coinbase’s newest endeavor has been hitting the retail market making users able to pay for things using their crypto assets. They have enabled users to purchase e-gift cards as well as enabled certain transactions with specific merchants to be made directly through their app. Coinbase takes the struggle of taking crypto assets and converting into usable currency away from their clients. Simplifying the process and making the crypto market even more user friendly across the globe. 

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
* Coinbase covers a wide variety of brokerage, payment, support, and security functions for the crypto asset field. Over the last 5-10 years there has been a major shift in the value and accessibility of crypto currency. The new market has seen a lot of volatility and uncertainty of its ability to be a valuable investment. Coming into 2020, there is much greater technological power than existed back in 2009 when the first bitcoin transaction occurred. Today, Coinbase is in a competitive marketplace alongside Gemini, BitPay, Coinalytics, Blockchain, and Kraken.io. As technological advances have occurred such as the cloud, IOT, cell phones, and computer processing capabilities, the crypto asset industry looks more and more appealing to both retail and institutional investors. It was merely a few years back that Bitcoin took their first major tumble and a lot thought of the industry as unsustainable. Looking at the future, it appears that cryptocurrency will begin to dominate more and more of the asset pool for both retail and institutional clients. 

## Results:

* Coinbase’s easy to use interface has attracted a variety of investors, opening the floor to those who may not have had access otherwise. Their interface and support have created a platform for users with no knowledge of the market all the way up to seasoned professionals. Coinbase listens to their client’s needs and wants no matter how small or large. From basics all the way up to Coinbase Pro for institutions, their application has allowed growth and development for all stages of this emerging marketplace. 
* Coinbase measures their success based off their core values. First and foremost, they want to be user friendly and safe. Having clients that range from Billy Bob from Alabama all the way up to large institutions using the platform to trade solidifies their top place in the marketspace. Maintaining their interface and listening to users is one of their major keys to success. Through their blog you can tell they have a wonderful customer service team that creates consistent updates for users. 

## Recommendations:

* It appears to me as if Coinbase is trying to be a one stop shop for all your crypto asset needs. This appears great in theory, but limiting when so many people do their finances through financial advisors or banks. A way to mesh to crypto assets into people’s ability to qualify for a loan, mortgage etc. plus payments would be a great next step for Coinbase in the coming years. Offering abilities to partner with banks to make these transactions would be key. Working alongside financial advisors to mesh crypto assets into their general portfolios is another great way to further integrate crypto currencies into our economy. 
* The more accessible crypto assets become to the general public, the more Coinbase will be able to do with their platform. Currently they are just now expanding into the retail market but there is so much untapped opportunity there if gone about the right way at the right time. Making cryptocurrency a more widely accepted and used form of currency won’t happen overnight by any means, but it holds a lot of great potential especially if you begin to consider inflation rates in various countries. Working with international governments and businesses will create a need for varying security features and transaction protocol. Relatively the same format of technologies would be used to expand Coinbase’s current reach. Varying configurations of these technologies will have to be adapted to fit new needs as they arise in the marketplace.
